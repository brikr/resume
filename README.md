GitHub repository of my 2021 solutions: https://github.com/brikr/advent-of-code-2021  
_Day 19 was probably my favorite challenge from this year. I knew the solution involved some linear algebra to match up the data sets, but I never took that class in school. It felt like I had to invent some math that I knew existed, which was a lot of fun._
